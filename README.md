# Dev-ERP
This project was developed for the management of a small business. Here I'm aporting all her interfaces, with absolute utility.  It has been developed in C# .NET with WPF using the Material Design theme, connecting to a local database launched through a Docker container, in which each of the data was obtained. Without overlooking its development in MVC, in addition to the use of the Master-Slave Pattern in some of its windows and the generation of automatic invoices with SAP Crystal Reports.
